      <h3 id="para1">History of Web Developers </h3>
      <p>The History of the Web stretches back to the 50’s and 60’s, with WAN and LAN networks being used to connect and convey information. The true modern history of Web Development began in the CERN laboratory, which developed the WorldWideWeb. App and HTML. The first major internet browser, Mosaic, would operate using these tools. These tools were also made publicly available, so flocks of hobbyists and entrepreneurs eagerly dissected and mastered them. Later tools like Flash, JavaScript, and CSS would go on to revolutionize Web Design once again, offering more tools for visual customization and interactivity.</p>

      <h3 id="para2">Effect on Society</h3>
      <p>Web Developer have, no doubt, affected society, from the way we communicate, consume media, and our perceptions of the world and others. Our communication is free and near instantaneous, allowing ideas to circulate throughout communities and the world. We consume media on mass, from modern TV and Film to first films ever created, straight from a browser. Web Designers have changed our perceptions of others and ourselves, social media giving rise to the “rat race” of self-worth and projection. These effects on society are a double-edged sword, something that should be approached with caution and respect. </p>

      <h3 id="para3">Effect on Business</h3>
      <p>Web Authors and the internet have utterly changed the way we do commerce and has given rise to completely new forms of business. Companies are not required to be “brick and mortar” anymore, capable of existing and thriving based solely on their online presence. Web Authors created new forms of monetization, from clicks and views to the raw data of users. Businesses since the advent of the internet have adapted to sell their products and services directly to the consumer forgoing the need for distribution costs.</p>

      <h3 id="para4">Ethics of Web Design</h3>
      <p>Web Developers, front and back end, have some of the loosest ethics of any profession. At the highest levels, they are willing to con adults and children alike out of their money or data, they are willing to use “Dark” design features to create addicting apps, and they view human data as numbers to improve their business metrics and create predatory advertising. Everyone thinks of the sleazy, unethical, psychopathic banker as the cartoonish evil businessman, but the modern-day version is a tech startup programmer who weaponizes data and psychology to purposely high jack a person’s mind and wallet. </p>

      <h3 id="para5">Future of Web Design</h3>
      <p>The future of Web Design, like any field in technology, is difficult to predict or ascertain. The industry evolves constantly and quickly, trends come and go, practices shift and drop. I do know one thing; the current version of the internet is the wild west. The of the internet are vague and barely enforced. I personally hate the idea of censorship and consider myself an advocate for freedom of expression, but even I understand that the internet and companies involved in it need some serious law and regulations. The internet is a minefield made of candy, enticing but dangerous; It represents the very best and worst of society, it needs to be reined in and protected from potential abusers or victims.</p>
