                    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
                    <p>Researching the issue of stagnation in the video game industry has been both enlightening and terrifying. While my interviewees certainly provided me with several distinct opinions on, and answers to, the question, they also left me with much uncertainty and a thousand other branching questions. The issue is truly varied and complex, something most certainly will not be solved anytime soon, but it is something which we can work to fix.</p>
                    <p>Over the course of these interviews, I have deduced some simple steps that video game developers and publishers could begin implementing today which would greatly improve the quality of their games, fighting the current stagnation the industry is facing: Understand what makes your game, or IP, special, give your player the agency to enjoy your game how they would like to, and choose a dedicated system(s) to develop your game for. A developer that implements one of these changes would result in a positive change in their entire development process, but multiple developers implementing all these changes would result in industry-wide change and progress.</p>
                    <p>All industries change and evolve within their own spheres, but they do not evolve within a vacuum; The internet affected multiple industries, the companies that changed with it succeeded but those who did not floundered. The world is facing some of its most troubling times, war, famine, recession, and natural disasters. Now, more than ever, people need an escape which is comforting and fulfilling, not an escape which is uninspired and distressing. Game developers, and publishers, play an understated, but important, role in fulfilling the escapism needs of the world. Developers who remain ahead of the curve, developers who are willing to give gamers what they want, developers who understand what makes a game special, developers who adapt to new technologies and innovate will be the developers who continue to succeed and thrive regardless of how hostile or distressing the world becomes. </p>
