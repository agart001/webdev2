                <ul>
                    <li class="interviewer">All righty. So just some basic questions first. Your name?</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">David Antognoli.</li>
                    <li class="interviewer">Your age?</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">39.</li>
                    <li class="interviewer">And where did you recieve your education?</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">I did my undergrad and my masters at Indiana University Bloomington.</li>
                    <li class="interviewer">Gotcha. And your current employment and past employment?</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">I work. I'm an assistant professor of game design at Columbia College, Chicago. And I've worked a bunch of places doing random contracts. I guess notably, would be like Microsoft. And then before that, I worked at a game development company called High Voltage software.</li>
                    <li class="interviewer">Gotcha. What do you do for Microsoft?</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">I worked on training materials, or I guess you could say learning materials for Microsoft products that intersect with the Unity game engine. So specifically, things like Visual Studio, and Azure. So there'll be like, it would be like, let's make a tutorial about how to use Azure to authenticate in your unity game with Facebook, or let's use Azure to make a leaderboard for a game in unity, that kind of stuff. Also, just like the documentation for Visual Studio tools for unity, and I think actually did documentation for Visual Studio for Mac to back when that was brand new.</li>
                    <li class="interviewer">And what did you do at High Voltage?</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">I was a game designer. So I worked on I started off the first game I worked on after college was Dora the Explorer store saves the snow princess. And then after that, I started when the conduit project was about halfway done, they decided to add multiplayer. And so I was kind of the main designer working on that. But we didn't really have a lot of flexibility because the game was mainly done. And then on kind of a two, I basically headed up like the sandbox gameplay design, I guess I'd say like so. Things like movement metrics and systems, weapons, enemy AI. And then also the, the, all the multiplayer stuff for that, including the UI and all that stuff. So it was a small team. So all the folks did a ton of things.</li>
                    <li class="interviewer">What are some of your favorite games currently, and why? I know, in adulthood, I'm personally feeling it now. There's not a lot of time to play games. But when I do get the time, there are definitely some ones that gravitate (to) more so.</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">Okay, so I really liked Half Life: Alyx I thought that was really good. Just because, you know, they, it was a pioneering VR project, I'd say. But it's also just really good for the same reasons that any game would be good in that genre, like good level design, good combat, etc. But they really kind of lead the way in a lot of the VR UX questions that have a lot of implications outside of the game industry.</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">I have recently I've been playing God of War, 2018, which I know there's a newer one, but this is just where I am. I thought that was really excellent. Because it was an interesting departure from all the other God of War stuff. And it really reminded me a lot of Resident Evil 4, which is one of my historic favorite games, which is not what I would have ever expected from a god of war game. But they really pulled off a really cool new direction for that franchise.</li>
                    <li class="interviewer">So what were some of your favorite games, growing up, and why?</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">I mean, growing up, I grew up in kind of the NES era. --- there were a lot fewer games. So the ones that were good, were pretty easy to agree and identify, like, you know, Mario, Mario to Mario, three, Megaman Castlevania. I wasn't into the early RPGs just because I was a kid.</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">And then around the Super Nintendo era, I started to appreciate that stuff more. So I'd play I played Earthbound --- Mario RPG was really good. You know, obviously, all the Mario games were awesome in that era. I didn't really like Super Metroid. And like Chrono Trigger, I didn't ever actually end up playing those until a lot later.</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">Then, let's see, like, PlayStation era. I really liked Resident Evil two, and Metal Gear Solid. In those I think in like Final Fantasy seven. So that kind of generation. I think I was in like middle school. That was pretty impactful to me. I still really like those games a lot.</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">Then like in college, I really liked Metroid Prime was really awesome. I kind of like the Arcady sports games like going back all the way to NBA Jam, or NHL hits.</li>
                    <li class="interviewee"> Yeah, And then like, eventually, PC gaming. So, like, Half Life was a big, impactful game for me for sure. Doom, that stuff.</li>
                    <li class="interviewer">Have you ever been dissatisfied with a game at release? And why?</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">I'm sure I have. I'm trying to decide. --- I guess, you know, in the Internet era, you're not really surprised too much, because there's a lot of coverage that's really accessible. So you kind of know what you're getting into. But I'd say even even though the gameplay, when I first started itself is probably less of a surprise as much as, you know, when you start to see the writing on the wall that it's not going to be good.</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">So like, I don't know, like some of the I've been led down a lot by a lot of like Stark later Starfox games. It's like, why, what is this? --- The Cyberpunk game was kind of a letdown. But I honestly didn't think it was as bad as many people did, but certainly didn't live up to the lofty expectations. I played on PC. So I didn't get the worst of like, what? I guess it was ps4 version. That was really bad.</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">Those are things that come to mind. But I guess the takeaway for me is the the bad games are less memorable. Or I just know that they're gonna be bad ahead of time.</li>
                    <li class="interviewer">So what inspired you to go into the games industry? Was it a certain game?</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">Just playing games as a kid. Basically, you know, I remember distinctly playing Megaman where they have the boss robots at the end. And it's very easy as a kid to be like, "Oh, well, because they all have this naming convention", where, I don't know what they all are. "Cut Man", and "Snake Man", and "Pharaoh Man", and all this dumb stuff. So it's like, very easy as a young kid to think about what other kinds of bosses they could have.</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">And then same thing with like, Mortal Kombat fatalities. So those are those are early things I remember wondering about as a kid. So then, I guess it just, you start to wonder, okay, well, what can be an actual job as you get older then? That seemed like a promising idea at the time.</li>
                    <li class="interviewer">Well, what sort of started your your coding or programming journey?</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">Let's see, I originally in school was always, you know, more into like English and Social Studies, as opposed to like math and back then, you know, computer programming was a lot less accessible. We certainly didn't have it in school until college, you know. It was also, like, the technologies itself was less accessible, it's more more cryptic, less user friendly.</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">Really, the game industry kind of worked, like how I'm about to describe, where designers were did more documentation, and writing, and communication, and less creating assets. That started to change and, as I started to realize, "okay, you have to make like a portfolio to get a job in the game industry and in the 21st century." This was before, Unity and Unreal, were really things you could just download. It was before YouTube, to be honest. I've seen a lot of weird changes over time in terms of that, but I just was very hard to discover how you actually made a game.</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">Then, eventually, I met somebody in grad school, who is a really motivated and talented programmer who made his own game engine called a "Flat Red Ball." It's still a thing, It's open source, It's mainly a 2D Engine now. He, sort of, introduced programming to me and showed me how it was relevant to video games.</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">Really, the game engine thing was the missing link. Because when you just sit down, you're like, "Well, I guess I have to like figure out rendering and figure out all this stuff that is like insane to try to program on your own." Unless you're really talented programmer, which, you know, that wasn't my goal. So rather than trying to have to make your own game engine, being able to like start with the game engine was a game changer.</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">And that led me to realize, if you want to make your own stuff, you need to know programming. And it was like, after my first job as a game designer, and I started trying to get more into the indie space. It just became more and more obvious that programming, you know, like, none of my indie games made really much money at all. So I had a bunch of random, like game development, contract jobs, and almost all of them were programming related, because that's just in demand a lot more. So I've kind of transitioned into more of a technical role over the years. Just out of necessity, I guess.</li>
                    <li class="interviewer">Right? Contracting for Design jobs is a little bit more scarce, I imagine?</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">It's out there, like, especially now, when they have such big AAA projects look like there'll be a lot of like, like, we need designers to make a billion cutscenes or, you know, like not create the animations, but like, say this animation plays here, this character moves here doing things</li>
