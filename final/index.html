                    <h1>Topic Background</h1>
                    <p>Games as a medium of entertainment have existed for thousands of years. The first games were simple games of chance played with die made of goat teeth, but the constant evolution of technology and knowledge lead to more complex rules, game loops, and mediums. Card Games, Board Games, Video Games. Games have, and always will be, an integral part of human society, playing into our animalistic needs for accomplishment, fulfillment, and competition in a light-hearted setting without real consequence.</p>
                    <p>I have lived in the best era to be a “Gamer,” the epoch of video games. A time when art, science, and creativity have come together to make the most beautiful collection of entertainment that human society has ever seen. At their core, video games are not a far cry away from the goat teeth die roots, they still function on rule sets and game loops while existing in a medium which would be considered sorcery to ancient gamers.</p>
                    <p>Video games, like the games of the past, have pulled inspiration from many other games that have come before, mixing, and mashing their rules and loops to create completely new and interesting ideas. However, no matter how vast a set of different ideas is, there will always be repeats, rehashes, and poor imitations. Today’s modern era of video games, an epoch of microtransactions and publisher greed, is not different; Most AAA video games feel staler and more uninspired than ever, a market saturated with games that can only seem to put the most minor spin on their progenitor and expect to be valued higher than ever before.</p>

                    <h1>Topic Mission</h1>
                    <p>Finding the root cause of any form stagnation is the best practice when trying to move towards a state of growth or flow. You would clear a river’s blockage, instead of just digging a new river. The root cause of the current stagnation being experienced in the video game market, and industry, is multifaceted, complex, and far reaching. A cause whose own roots may stretch back thousands of years, a cause which may be symptomatic of modern consumer society, a cause which may only appear to those looking for it. The goal of my research, and by extension this website, is to explore the facets of this cause through lens and opinions of others, those who actively participate multiple aspects of videos games.</p>
                    <p>As a lifelong enjoyer of video games, and as someone who intends to work in the video game industry, I choose to pursue this search of the root causes of video game stagnation in the hopes of gaining more insight into the opinions, thought processes, and values of gamers and game industry professionals, budding or otherwise. Trying to find the common ground on which all those who interact with video games in any form lay their foundation; How their own subjective experiences, tastes, and desires share any congruency and how that congruency could be used to improve the quality of their participation. </p>

                    <h1>Topic Method</h1>
                    <p>To root out, as it were, the root cause, or causes, of stagnation in the video game market, and industry, I conducted several interviews with several distinct interviewees. Each interviewee represents, and stands for, a different margin of person who participates in the video game genre: A professor with a background industry, A student going into adjacent industry, and a true gamer. Each interviewee, outside of the connection to the industry, is, and has been, a lifelong video game enjoyer, each a person who truly cherishes the genre and the experiences it has afforded them.</p>
                    <p>By interviewing multiple people who have distinct, yet similar, connections to the video game genre, I was able to gain a diverse set of opinions and viewpoints on the question of stagnation in the genre. I asked questions which pertained to the aspects of video games which they valued, in both their past and present experience. I asked questions about how they have satisfied, or dissatisfied, with any aspect of their participation in the genre. I asked questions about how they believed the stagnation, and the genre, could be remedied, or revitalized.</p>
