                    <h1>Take Away</h1>
                    <p>Jacob Nader provided me with a unique perspective. He is a budding young professional with questions about his place within the industry and a desire to understand, or change, its status quo, we are peers on common ground. We certainly share many of the same perspectives and feelings, but he still left with many new thoughts and ideas: Innovation can be as much an alienator as it can be an attractor. Rehashes become the standards that will be rehashed in the future.</p>
                    <p>My research and exploration of stagnation in the video game genre is, in many ways, a demand for innovation or a demand for something greater than before, but Nader provided me with many examples as to why innovation is not always the strongest move, or even required in some case, and to be careful of what I wish for. Nader grew up playing the Zelda and Halo franchises; Two legacy IPs from major established studios, and he has watched them evolve and iterate over the years as the landscape and hardware of video games has done the same. While Nader enjoyed some of the ways these IPs have evolved from their original concepts and formulas, not every change was warranted or effective in his opinion. Nader states his opinion on the Zelda title, Breath of the Wild move from linear to open world, <i>“I definitely feel like it alienated a lot of people going from linear to open world. But I also really sort of liked how they executed it. It's just not really what I play Zelda for. --- I don't like the way that the dungeons were executed in that one either. They felt a lot A lot less complex. --- there was not a lot of gear that you would pick up --- that's something that Zelda is known for is having those cool gadgets. --- there was a story the collecting the tools, in most cases, like you could tell from the area that you were in ---.”</i></p>
                    <p>Nader also made an extremely beautiful and eloquent statement about his opinions and feelings on the ability of games to develop new pillars of gameplay, leaving me at a loss for words, that wonderfully encapsulates how different genres, or anything else really, are built upon that which came before. <i>“I feel like we will always see these similar looking pillars in the halls of games, but there will always be like a new motif on them, there always be a new design that goes along with the pillar. So while the pillar itself might not change, it's the stuff on the pillar that will change. And that's a good way to go about it, because eventually, we'll get to a point where the pillar is still there. But it looks entirely different. Now we have a new type of game. Thus creating an entirely new pillar in the process starts again, people start taking from one thing they like, putting it on that pillar, that another person that played that game gets in the animation, or a game industry puts their own spin on the pillar that keeps changing somewhere, and so forth.”</i></p>

                    <li class="interviewer">Your full name?</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">Jacob Nader.</li>
                    <li class="interviewer">Your age?</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">I am 24.</li>
                    <li class="interviewer">What's your current level of education?</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">I am currently a junior transfer student. I'm here at the Columbia College in Chicago in the Animation Department.</li>
                    <li class="interviewer">Are you currently employed at this time?</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">Currently I'm working at the College of DuPage as a professional. I'm a computer for the animation program there.</li>
                    <li class="interviewer">What are some of your favorite games currently? And why?</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">Okay, so to start, one of my most popular and most favorite games I've been playing last 10 years is: Destiny 2. I have been a huge fan of Bungie ever since Halo: Reach came out. That was the first one I played from them, then I went back and played Halo 3 and Halo 1. The only one from the series that I haven't played fully is Halo 2.</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">But Destiny, Destiny is my favorite game because just the variety of armor and customization that you get to have in the game. I like games that allowed me to show off fashion and really customize my character and also the gunplay in there. It just feels so smooth. It's something that was really good in Halo and I feel like Bungie's really done a good job of carrying that over from Halo to Destiny.</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">There's also the variety of different powers that you can have, which I just find really delightful. I like causing like big explosions with the fire subclasses and then they added this new one and, The newest expansion called Strand, where you like, you can tie up enemies so I've been playing a class called Titan and he has like abilities that suspend enemies, restrain them, so that's been pretty fun.</li>
                    <li class="interviewer">Right, I mean Destiny is one of those live service games, it just has an almost never ending stream of content until they finally decide to stop supporting it.</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">Absolutely. Yeah, that's one of the things that kind of is at a detriment to it, I feel, but also like they can always keep adding on, but like if the expansions aren't like worthwhile then, and like people start to fall off, so they really want to make sure that those expansions hit with enough impact to last like till the next one. Which they've been kind of hit or miss here and there.</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">The most recent expansion. While I loved it, it was a great quality of life expansion, good gameplay expansion. The story really wasn't there and this has been like something that the community in the game has echoed. A lot of the main plot points really just came out of nowhere. There was no build up and, It left a lot of questions that should have been answered on the answer, but other than that, like the expansion was really cool.</li>
                    <li class="interviewer">So it almost seems like you love this game, not only in spite of its flaws, but almost to a degree because of some of its flaws, right?</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">Oh yeah, like there's some really fun stuff that occurs from flaws being unfixed. Like there was a bunch of, map glitches that were you could get outside the borders of the area and start running around. People were finding all these secrets, and this has been happening all the way back in D1, Destiny 1. People would glitch out of the map on the Cosmetrome, which is on Earth in Russia, and they would go into like the secret area that had, I think, the only time we fight a s- It's a certain enemy: a group called the House of Kings.</li>
                    <li class="interviewer">It's a designer's nightmare. But it's also to their delight and their nightmare all at the site, all at the same time, I'm sure.</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">It spawned a bunch of like returning gags. So for the 30th anniversary expansion, that they released back in COVID times they brought back this old bug and turned it into a dungeon. It was like a loot cave. It was an exploit where players were using it to get a lot of extremely powerful loot. And they turned it into this whole grandiose story of a t- team of players that went in there, seeking the loot and went crazy and started killing each other for it.</li>
                    <li class="interviewer">That's fantastic! I love it when developers can just sort of. Laugh at themselves and not take their their projects too seriously to an extent.</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">Absolutely. I feel like Bungie does a wonderful job of that. Their, their community managers and all their staff are just very kind individuals and very outwardly open about what's going on at Bungie. There have been some instances where they need to give more clarification, but they always get around to it.</li>
                    <li class="interviewer">Well, switching gears a bit, what were some of your favorite games growing up and why?</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">Oh my god let's see. Spyro. Spyro. The dragon was one of my all time favorites. Still probably to this day. I play the reignited trilogy almost every year. I think it's my favorite just because I liked, I like Spyro.</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">Spyro, the character himself was a very appealing character to me. I like the little purple dragon. I like that he was voiced by Tom Kenny, although I didn't know it was him at the time. I just liked his voice. And the little dragonfly that follows him, Spark, is also really cool. I love one of the first. Once I played there were levels where you just got to play as Spark and I love to go in through those sections as well because it gave a lot of variety and kind of deepened what was going on in the world. "I'm not just playing as Spyro. I'm playing on all these different characters" and you get to play as more than just spark. You get to play as like a kangaroo, a space monkey, a military penguin with a jet pack and rocket. It's crazy. That's why I like Spyro too. They're not really grounded in reality. They're just having fun with it. And I think that's one of the most important things you can have in any game.</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">Another one that I think really got me into some stuff. Later in my life was Legend of Zelda. I always liked like the sort of more linear Zelda where you like you're going from dungeon to dungeon. I'm not so much a fan of the open world ones. Although they are very impressive. I really liked the formula of going from dungeon to dungeon. And going through all that getting getting the items to beat the boss and saving the day. At the end of the day. It was a cool, it was a cool fantasy to live out in link in his many forms is just really fun to be around. I think my favorite one would have to be Twilight Princess or Windwaker. Both had very different art styles. I love the mechanics that they implemented in both of them. They each bring a more like a very different take on the Zelda universe. So I feel like it was very refreshing to play both of those. Especially since I started on Windwaker and went to Twilight Princess.</li>
                    <li class="interviewer">Right? I've always found that to be one of the most beautiful and like alluring parts about the Zelda series is its constant evolution, or at least its availableness to evolve. I feel like a lot of game IPs, they kind of get stuck, bogged down in the things that made their games famous,and made the money, and they're too afraid to try new things. For the longest time, like you said, like Legend of Zelda was a purely linear experience. There was a certain progression you had follow, sure, but it wasn't completely linear. You could stumble around and go to places you weren't supposed to yet but there's always sort of gates blocking you, item gates, quest gates. They went ahead and did away with all of that with Breath of the Wild and that's a that's a big jump, especially when your entire fan base is used to one type of gameplay experience.</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">I definitely feel like it alienated a lot of people going from linear to open world. But I also really sort of liked how they executed it. It's just not really what I play Zelda for. Crafting systems are great in other games. I don't really think it belongs in Zelda. I don't like the way that the dungeons were executed in that one either. They felt a lot A lot less complex. And they all just revolve around the Sheikah Slate. And I think different hero powers once you got to a certain part in the dungeon, but there was not a lot of gear that you would pick up besides the Sheikah Slate and I feel like that's something that Zelda is known for is having those cool gadgets. Like the Sheikah Slate is cool, but I would rather use the cool gear itself like I want to be firing hook shot, I want to be throwing the bombs. I want to be like, controlling the statues with the magic wand.</li>
                    <li class="interviewer">I definitely get what you mean, they kind of not simplified things, but sort of put them all in a conglomerate in this Sheikah Slate and in essence, almost sort of missed the point of the value of those types of gadgets was from the experience of having to collect that ability. And your gripe, at least from my outside opinion looking in is it's like, you kind of start with most if not all the Sheikah Slate abilities from the get go. You know what I mean? You have pretty much all of them to an extent. And it's like you there was you know, a small journey to unlock all of them but only in the tutorial. And then after that it's almost like they're they're opening a sandbox to you, but you already have all the tools. And part of what made Zelda fun was collecting the tools.</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">Yeah, there was a story the collecting the tools, in most cases, like you could tell from the area that you were in that you the people that were there use this tool to accomplish a certain thing. And now that's been left behind, it's there for you to find and you get to pick it up and you get to use it however they would have used it.</li>
                    <li class="interviewer">Kind of pivoting once again, but not even really pivoting so much as it is continuing this topic. Have you ever been dissatisfied with a game at release and why?</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">There's a couple that I've been actually kind of disappointed by, just the first one we can talk about is Turtle Rock studio's spiritual successor to Left 4 Dead, made originally by Valve and Turtle Rock back in the early 2000s. It's called Back 4 Blood. I was highly anticipating this game it looked really cool. They added a lot more guns and customizations but the writing in the story I feel like was not good. And the special infected in the game.</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">They're enemies that have special powers. There's your rank and file zombies, and then you have special ones. This was in Left 4 Dead and they brought it back in some capacity with Back 4 Blood, but I just feel like it's not the same.They don't have the same like personality they feel weaker, they feel more, I don't want to say, reliant on each other. But in comparison to Left 4 Dead you can make a good play with two infected and take out a whole team of survivors, whereas it feels like in this game if you have a team of four special infected, and a team of four survivors, one of the survivors could kill you all. It doesn't really feel like the special infected has that much impact.</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">The story was, again, just not where I wanted it to be with the writing. A lot of the voice lines did not click with me, they felt a little bit cheesy and out of place all the time. It had its moments, it had its moments, there was one level, towards the beginning of the game, where you have to create a distraction at a local bar and you hit the juice box that starts playing music and it goes through all these old, like really cool, fight songs. Black Betty I think, Rage Against the Machine was in there, and some other stuff, and it was it was a really cool like standoff. It was good storytelling, that was good set design, told from the environment. And the way that you got up there was really cool too. You're going like through all these different teams that like died, essentially trying to get to that one. But other than that level and a couple of other points in the game, The story was kind of lacking.</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">Another one, that I'm really surprised, I'm going to say this, but I used to really be sweet on this game. Because I'd play it like every day. I'm a big fan of sharks. This game called Depth. It's a very small indie team.</li>
                    <li class="interviewer">I think I've heard of it before it's the asymmetrical PvP, like scuba divers versus sharks, right?</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">Yeah, two sharks versus four divers. You're escorting a payload bot that's collecting treasure, and trying to just collect all the treasure that you can and make it back to the dive boat alive. The sharks see you as invaders in their territory, and they're trying to get you I absolutely love the gameplay loop to death with this game. I just feel like it didn't get enough attention. So they either didn't have enough backing to consider the game worth their time or they just don't have the manpower to do it. I don't understand the situation with them, but it just didn't feel like they were supporting the game enough. And it got really stale after a while. I absolutely love playing the game, but like I could only, if I played it today, probably play like one or two matches before I get bored of it.</li>
                    <li class="interviewer">Kind of reminds me, I feel like there is was an epidemic of like, the start of the whole early access trend in like the early 2010s. Like around like 2012 to 2015, there was a whole bunch of indie multiplayer games that just blew up on on YouTube and the whole internet space. Depth. Contagion. A lot of games that sort of spawned from like the old Gmod game modes, they sort of existed as like shells of game modes and they just weren't able to flesh themselves out into entire games in their own right.</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">That's the thing too, I feel like when you focus an entire game around a single game mode, you're gonna have issues. Like, unless you can constantly support it, and keep fleshing it out, you're gonna lose player base, you're gonna lose support for the game. And ultimately, it's not going to be worth it, you really need to have a set of core game modes, maybe even a campaign, that will keep your players busy, active and coming back.</li>
                    <li class="interviewer">One of the things that I think of, is when you have a game with multiple game modes, you obviously need like a like a flagship, like search and destroy or bomb defuse, like, you know, Counter Strike. But they have all these other random things like gun game, free for all, deathmatch. But then despite that, even if people only really want to play that one game mode, they only really want to play diffuse, right? Like the way that they keep that alive is a ranked system. There needs to be incentive to continue to play the same game mode, same game, every single time.</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">I feel like a game that executes that pretty well, is Overwatch. Granted, it has its issues, a lot of them, but the player base is healthy. It's growing. They keep adding new events and stuff that keeps the game feeling fresh enough. I feel like where they really need to step it up is getting that secondary experience out, because it was promised to us at the release of Overwatch 2. I think that was one of the biggest slaps in the face for me, because I was really a fan of Overwatch back in like 2017, prior to like all the shitty stuff that was happening at Blizzard, and then they they cleaned house, they came back, they're doing Overwatch 2. And I was like, "Alright, I might I might come back and hang if Overwatch 2 is good," but I need I need that PVE. It doesn't feel like a new game.</li>
                    <li class="interviewer">Yeah, they definitely made some promises, but I guess it's a matter of how they fulfill and whether they come. Because I feel like TV shows can have a redemption, right? They could have a bad season, they come back with a better one and win people over to some degree, but I feel like games, it's a lot more to show for it. A game can start out really horrendous and then become a absolute public darling.</li>
                    <li class="interviewer">I think No Man's Sky is a is a perfect example. I remember the release of that game, and the utter hype surrounding it. And the utter just, you know, shock and awe when it finally released. But now after however many years of continuous support the project is amazing. There's so much more content. I think that's one of the beautiful things about games, and game design, is just that they always have the opportunity to grow like that.</li>
                    <li class="interviewer">But pivoting again, to more career focused questions, what originally inspired you to go into the animation industry?</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">Okay, so when I was around 11/12 ish, I stumbled across this company called RoosterTeeth. I started watching them for "Achievement Hunter" primarily. And then I started seeing these animations come out by a guy named "Monty."" He's an extremely talented animator, and is still one of my biggest inspirations to this day. I don't follow in his footsteps with 3d animation. But I really enjoyed how he choreographed scenes for animation. And the other personality that he put into it. It was really heartwarming and inspiring to see that.</li>
                    <li class="interviewee"> And when you saw the 3d animated segments for "Red vs Blue", in Ruby, two of his his babies that he worked on up until his untimely death. They were so cool. They were so cool. I think one of my favorite fight scenes from red versus blue has to be the car chase scene during season nine. In that show, the story follows during season nine, a group of mercenaries called "Freelancers," they work for Splinter Cell groups and a military group called "O.N.I," which is the Office of Naval Intelligence. It's inspired by Halo.</li>
                    <li class="interviewee"> So it follows a lot of the the core story of that but they are trying to break in steal an artifact that belong to an alien race. They get intercepted by a military group associated with the official military, and have to fight their way out, and it's it's just such a cool scene. At one point they jump off of a skyscraper as it gets demolished, and land on a Jeep, and have to dodge and weave through traffic going the opposite direction to them, while they're being chased by 4 other cars. And it turns into this car hopping fight where everybody's got jetpacks, except for the guys we're following, and they have to like grab on to cars, hop to from a truck bed to truck bed, and like you think, "Somebody's gonna die. Somebody's definitely gonna die." But somehow they pull it off and make it out with injuries, yes, but like they all make it out. And I think that that's probably the moment where I said, "I want to do animation." Then I started getting into anime. I started watching stuff like, Full Metal Alchemist, and Soul Eater. And Oh My God, that stuff just sent me over the edge, I was like "I gotta do this now."</li>
                    <li class="interviewer">Right? They do some crazy nonsense and anime in terms of animation. I don't know, it's utterly wild, especially some of the stuff coming out nowadays, that's for sure.</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">Yeah, I get so jealous when I see like some of the stuff on TV now. Because like, I really want to make something that good. But I know like, they have a team of like 20 people working on like one of those scenes, like there's so much that goes into just getting a four second clip of animation that when you're watching, and as a 12 year old, you're like, Oh, I could definitely do that. And then you look at it now. And like, I don't know, I can just draw a circle. Maybe shaded a bit.</li>
                    <li class="interviewer">What was the original goal of your animation journey? Was there like a specific idea, a show, or sort of a webcomic, or anything that you really wanted to put out there? Like a defining this is an idea for something I want to do? Or was there even like a company you wanted to work for?</li>
                    <li class="interviewee"> Originally, I wanted to work for RoosterTeeth in that then, after a time, I was in high school, I started doing a little bit of a creative writing project on my own. I got really invested in it. I wanted to start my own studio, and I wanted to be a showrunner. I still really want to do that. But I feel like I need to jump into the industry and get some experience first.</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">I feel like for a lot of people, it's just not feasible to go from, "Oh, I'm a college graduate," to "Hey, I run a studio now." If you could do that, that's awesome, that's phenomenal, and I applaud you for that. But like for the majority of folks getting into animation, I feel like it's really important that you have grounded goals when getting into the industry. This is something that I've had to learn since getting here.</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">I'm not a one man army. I am not the best writer that I could be right now. And so I really need to work on getting myself to the place where people will want to work with me and throw myself out there, start working on projects with other people, get a team, and then go for it.</li>
                    <li class="interviewer">That almost kind of leads into my other question, which was: How did the reality of animation development, and sort of that whole sphere, how did that reality differ from your expectations?</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">It was scary. It was very scary, it's still scary to this to this day. I am constantly feeling like, there's not going to be a place in the industry for me. But I know that's not true, there's always going to be something that I can do as an animator. And if I just keep working at it, if I keep drawing, I will be there. But something that was really hard for me to accept. was that I needed to, like, really practice, like, keep going. Early on when I was first getting into college and high school, I was like, "Oh, I got this, I can do this. I don't need to practice drawing." And then I saw all the other students projects in my intro class, when I was first starting at COD, and it was very demoralizing to say the least. I didn't really want to continue after that first class. But then, after trying an anthropology course, I like anthropology is a subject, but I don't think I want to do that. So I went back to animation. And I tried it again.</li>
                    <li class="interviewer">So another year sort of pivot here.Going back to questions about game industry and the sort of market surrounding it. Are you satisfied with the current video game market and development culture? If not, why?</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">Absolutely not. I feel like the trends that I've been seeing, in recent years from the video game industry, have been abhorrent. In most cases, like, you look at Cyberpunk 2077, you look at Red Dead Redemption 2, you look at Halo 2, in one of the worst instances of unfair workplace practices and something needs to be done. I don't know if I'm necessarily the person to tell people what that is. But for instance, like on Halo 2, they made the entire game in the in 10 months to line up with Microsoft's release of the Xbox 360.</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">They had to work 16 hour days, seven days a week for that whole 10 months just to try to get out the game. They had to cut so much content, granted that got shoved into Halo 3, but the way that that was executed, I feel like cannot and should not happen ever again. There needs to be proper amount of time for a studio to output something that they are proud of, and that they know a studio or publisher will be very happy with. I feel like some instances that we could see change for like reducing the the amount of time that we are making workers work for one. That's pretty obvious. That's that's where I would start. There has been talk of switching to a four day work week in the videogame industry, from some articles that I've read. As well as putting proper protections in place and a support system to make sure that teammates, and team members, on development teams are taking care of themselves, they're doing mentally well; because you and me both know this. The Internet can be a very hostile place to developers when a game is not to their liking.</li>
                    <li class="interviewer">Yeah, honestly, the thing I feel about the sort of current development culture is, there's almost a pride in the crunch. Which I think is kind of a bad thing to some degree, people talk about this crunch culture and how they want it to change, right, but it's such a competitive sort of industry. Even if you have a job, everybody's trying to show that they're working the hardest on the project, everybody's trying to get that extra little "1 UP." So while management may not legally be responsible for the fact that, you know, people are putting in 16 hour days, like they're not demanding that you do it. People are so concerned about being cut off, or fired, or not seeming like they care about their project, and trying to just "1 UP" each other. It's that competition to see who can do the most. Next thing you know, everybody's out here pulling 16 An hour days, because if you're not everybody looks at you weird.</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">For some instances of voluntary crunch, with like indie game studios, I'd say it's a matter of like that feeling that you get when you are in the zone, you're on a rush. I don't know, if you've experienced this when you're working on something, but when you get into a groove, you do not want to put it down. If you put it down, you are not going to be able to get the same mojo back, you're not going to be in the same workflow, and it's all gonna peter out, you're gonna have to come back to it at a later date. So you have the vision in your head, you can't let it go.</li>
                    <li class="interviewer"> Exactly. I feel like that definitely contributes a lot to the gaming crunch culture, animation crunch culture. Like, it's that moment and if you lose that moment, getting it back is definitely a pain. So another question for you. Do you feel as though video game developer creativity is being stifled by corporate interest?</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">Ab-So-lutely. A lot of the big, AAA, game publishers will absolutely have their input on what gets into the story. If you look at games like Call of Duty, they're all sponsored by the American military. And in some cases, I believe the government, I don't know if that's 100% True. But I know for sure the military is involved with production of those games, in some capacity, at least. So they are going to have some say over that. Especially when games have pointed message. A lot of publishers feel threatened by that, that's a lot of risk that they're taking on. And they don't want that, that hurts sales, that hurts the bottom line. And that's the one thing that you don't fuck with, for a publisher.</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">I don't even feel like that's a solely video game industry to you look at the animation industry in Japan, it's very hierarchical. Over there, they have to follow exactly what the senior says. The senior decides the emotional impact of the animation. And they have to adhere to that. So if the emotional tone is one thing, and a animator that's on the lower scale or wrong, then the senior tries to give his voice, they're shut down. And that can be very stifling, very demoralizing and depressing for a lot of artists, because it feels like they have no impact. And they're just drawing what everybody else is telling him to draw, which is sadly the case in a lot of stuff. But at least for studios over here, I can't speak for some of the smaller studios or other studios in Japan, I've only heard of this hierarchical structure from papers, scientific papers that I've read.</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">I feel like over here, you have a lot more freedom and impact on how you're able to express in your animation that you can give ideas to the higher ups and not be told that it's not going to we're not going to do that. We're just gonna go with what that input is more value is the simpler.</li>
                    <li class="interviewer">I feel like almost with a lot of creative industries, with managers and production managers and that kind of deal. It's, it's kind of their way or the highway, right? And then it's just to a degree like you have all of these extremely creative people who went into the This industry to be able to, you know, monetize their creativity. But in monetizing their creativity, they've sort of shoved their creativity into a box. And that box is now in somebody else's toolkit. And they decide when and where and how its deployed. And it's almost seems like antithetical to the whole idea of creativity.</li>
                    <li class="interviewer">So another question for you. Do you feel as though gamers expectations for new games are too high?</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">I feel like in a lot of cases, yes. In some cases, no. Like, there's a certain like, happy medium that I feel like a game should always strive for. And that could be my own bias talking there. But like, there's a certain amount of quality that I do expect from a game. But I feel like a lot of the expectations of the gaming community at large is way too high. Like the internet one of the biggest reasons I attribute Cyberpunk 2077 disastrous launch to is the outside influence of us, the consumer.</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">Everybody was getting so angry that the game kept getting delayed. Investors were getting angry because we were angry. And that is hurting their bottom line. They're cancelling preorders, they're disinterested, because it keeps getting pushed back. But at the end of the day, CD Projekt RED, the developers of cyberpunk want to put out a good product, if you don't let them cook, and continue to polish that game. You get what we got with the release. Right game that was half unfinished, it was buggy. It had game breaking bugs were like it completely shut down a run. Thankfully, they patched it. But this all could have been avoided if they were allotted just a little more time to put the polish necessary on the game.</li>
                    <li class="interviewer">Right? I feel like it's, it's like you said that the stockholders the decision makers, they're, they're sitting there at that table, and they're like, when are we going to see this return? And they're just, they make developers push out a an unfinished product, unfinished product. But I feel like we're kind of almost not not leaving that phase. But we're in the ending stages of it, for sure. I feel like a lot of game developers and production companies are realizing that gamers will wait for you to make a good game. You know what I mean?</li>
                    <li class="interviewer">I think Bethesda is a good example of that, like, they they take, you know, their darn sweet time cooking their games. And while sometimes they may not, you know, live up to expectations. I know, people weren't utterly satisfied with Fallout 4. Right? But even though Fallout four has, you know, numerous bugs and glitches and a whole bunch of nonsense at release, right, it's, it's a "bug-thesda" title you expected a little bit, but it wasn't ever, like gamebreaking. You know what I mean? And I think that's just an add, you can attribute that to the development process. You know what I mean? They, they spend so much time and pre development and pre planning. And by the time they finally get there, like the whole, the list is all set out. And they've got the time to do it, per se.</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">I feel like at that point, when you're working on such a large scale with Bethesda games, like you look at Skyrim you look at Fallout, New Vegas, you look at Fallout four, you almost have to expect it. It's expected with such a large flushed out world. They're always on point with the storytelling in the world on granted 76 That was, but yeah, for the most part, but that's the on top of their world. It's very flushed out. It's beautiful to walk through, I could spend an entire week playing Skyrim go back to it, start a whole new game, and not be bored at all.</li>
                    <li class="interviewer">Right, right. Let's kind of the beautiful thing about some games is they're almost infinite replayability to an extent, like you may have to take a break, but some games you can just go back to and you can get that that bug once again.</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">And a lot of these bugs are not they weren't game breaking. They're just find like, half of the fun of Skyrim was being able to put a bucket on somebody's head. can't fucking see you. You put a bucket on your head you're invisible, boom!</li>
                    <li class="interviewer">But another sort of question for you along the same lines to some degree is, do you think all modern games indie AAA? See, like why do you think all modern games indie AAA, why do you think they all seem to share the same pillars of gameplay? And what I mean by pillars of gameplay is like, like a crafting system, or sort of like the loop of like exploration, and then reward, and then XY and Z, right? Like, I think a good example of like, a game that has very obvious pillars is Elden. Ring, right? So exploration, combat, all this other sort of stuff. And basically, my question is, is that can we escape the sort of pillars that we have right now? Can we make new pillars? Can there be different avenues for gameplay?</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">Think it's complicated question. Because everything's a remix. There will never be a game that doesn't include some form of respond mechanic like it's dark souls that spawned an entire genre of games just like it but every time they start pulling from new avenues, so like, with some indie developers, they've started to implement movement like Doom, or Titan fall into that equation. Level design is also a huge factor in and I feel like somebody who grew up playing Zelda, they're gonna want to game most like, laid out entirely like Zelda, it all comes down to what did that developer play as a kid? What do they want to bring to the table? And what do they want to fuse with it to make it new, and I feel like we will always see these similar looking pillars in the halls of games, but there will always be like a new motif on them, there always be a new design that goes along with the pillar. So while the pillar itself might not change, it's the stuff on the pillar that will change. And that's a good way to go about it, because eventually, we'll get to a point where the pillar is still there. But it looks entirely different. Now we have a new type of game. Thus creating an entirely new pillar in the process starts again, people start taking from one thing they like, putting it on that pillar, that another person that played that game gets in the animation, or a game industry puts their own spin on the pillar that keeps changing somewhere, and so forth.</li>
                    <li class="interviewer">I absolutely love the way that you phrase that because I do think that is kind of the way it is, you know what I mean? It's like you said, a lot of ideas. For most things at this point. Like, it almost feels as though almost everything has been thought of even though I know that's not true. But it's like with the internet and the visibility of it all and just sort of media collectively as a whole. You know, it definitely feels like a struggle to have fresh, new ideas. And you have to sort of re spin old ideas, and then you re spin those respond ideas, like you said, and next thing you know, it's so unrecognizable from the starting point that it's practically unrelated.</li>
                    <li class="interviewer">So another question for you. What is a game modern or otherwise you feel has pushed the envelope for the games industry forward? And why?</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">I've played so much. A lot of games, I could see how they push the envelope in different ways. So like, if I think about different genres of games, some titles come to mind. Stuff like Hollow Knight, I feel like is a good example of a game that pushes the boundaries of a certain genre. Awesome, and called a Metroidvania, which is sort of that exploration that 2d platforming exploration, but it infuses it with so much more movement elements that were available that weren't available other games and pushes it with even more storytelling in the world. All while doing 2d animation. So it pushes art style, it pushes gameplay. And I feel like it's a beautiful game for that genre.</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">Another game that I feel like, has sort of pushed the envelope in terms of Battle Royales, for instance, I would, I would probably say Hunt Showdown. It's a battle arena, where you are playing a hunter, a sort of Monster Hunter, if you will. That is in the 18th century, our 18th, early 1800s era of America primarily, the game is set around like the bayou, all like that. It's got that cool Southern, like cowboy aesthetic going for it. But the way that it pushes the envelope for me is that the focus is not actually about like, killing the players like Sure. The players, they're the players in there to interfere with you. But the main focus is getting killing the monster, banishing it getting out with the bounty. Right, ignore everything else. If you get out with that bounty, you are the winner.</li>
                    <li class="interviewer">So final, sort of end-er, for you here. Do you have any wishes, suggestions, sort of? Anything that if you could have it today or tomorrow? Like what are your wishes for the future of game development and the games industry as a whole.</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">More opportunities. I feel like for me at this point, a lot of opportunity is rooted in internships, like you have to get your foot in the door with internships. Internships are the most important thing. Having a good portfolio is another good step for that feel like but you really need to get your foot in the door with a company before they'll even consider you. Right, in a lot of cases, I feel like if we just allowed for more easy route to like maybe do a trial run at like some of these more big studios like Nickelodeon cartoon network. Because there's a lot of people that want to create. And I don't feel like a lot are given the opportunity to test their mettle as it were. Right? Or sort of cast out at the door when looking at like at internship applications.</li>
                    <li class="interviewer">You wish to an extent it wasn't so selective? or more so that you wish that there was just more opportunity to prove yourself outside of the standard techniques?</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">More opportunities to prove myself, primarily. I feel like a lot of the problem is how we monetize the tools they use for these products like sure, there are plenty of free software's. None of them come with any of what a studio is expecting you to know.</li>
                    <li class="interviewer">Exactly, because there's those those big tech deals for companies to pay, you know, yearly, vast amounts of money for, you know, Adobe, or Autodesk or X, Y, and Z. And it's, you know, if you don't have that industry standard training, it's kind of hard.</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">Unless you have the money to go to like someplace like Columbia or community college, where they're giving you the tools to practice with. You're going to be kind of Sol on that. I feel like unless you can afford it with your job outside of like, education. Right. I feel like that's increasingly uncommon, given how expensive everything else is getting, that's not really a big priority for people. What's important is making rent. Like, just getting enough money for food at the end of the day. It's like, I feel like that a lot of that is kind of secondary to people. Unless they're going to higher education.</li>
                    <li class="interviewer">Right. Well, Jacob, thank you so much for letting me interview you and for letting me hear your thoughts and your perspectives. super refreshing. Always enjoy talking to you.</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">Well, thank you for having me, Alex. It's always a pleasure talking to you. I enjoy our conversations.</li>
