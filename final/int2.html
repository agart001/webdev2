                    <li class="interviewer">Your full name?</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">Jacob Nader.</li>
                    <li class="interviewer">Your age?</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">I am 24.</li>
                    <li class="interviewer">What's your current level of education?</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">I am currently a junior transfer student. I'm here at the Columbia College in Chicago in the Animation Department.</li>
                    <li class="interviewer">Are you currently employed at this time?</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">Currently I'm working at the College of DuPage as a professional. I'm a computer for the animation program there.</li>
                    <li class="interviewer">What are some of your favorite games currently? And why?</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">Okay, so to start, one of my most popular and most favorite games I've been playing last 10 years is: Destiny 2. I have been a huge fan of Bungie ever since Halo: Reach came out. That was the first one I played from them, then I went back and played Halo 3 and Halo 1. The only one from the series that I haven't played fully is Halo 2.</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">But Destiny, Destiny is my favorite game because just the variety of armor and customization that you get to have in the game. I like games that allowed me to show off fashion and really customize my character and also the gunplay in there. It just feels so smooth. It's something that was really good in Halo and I feel like Bungie's really done a good job of carrying that over from Halo to Destiny.</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">There's also the variety of different powers that you can have, which I just find really delightful. I like causing like big explosions with the fire subclasses and then they added this new one and, The newest expansion called Strand, where you like, you can tie up enemies so I've been playing a class called Titan and he has like abilities that suspend enemies, restrain them, so that's been pretty fun.</li>
                    <li class="interviewer">Right, I mean Destiny is one of those live service games, it just has an almost never ending stream of content until they finally decide to stop supporting it.</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">Absolutely. Yeah, that's one of the things that kind of is at a detriment to it, I feel, but also like they can always keep adding on, but like if the expansions aren't like worthwhile then, and like people start to fall off, so they really want to make sure that those expansions hit with enough impact to last like till the next one. Which they've been kind of hit or miss here and there.</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">The most recent expansion. While I loved it, it was a great quality of life expansion, good gameplay expansion. The story really wasn't there and this has been like something that the community in the game has echoed. A lot of the main plot points really just came out of nowhere. There was no build up and, It left a lot of questions that should have been answered on the answer, but other than that, like the expansion was really cool.</li>
                    <li class="interviewer">So it almost seems like you love this game, not only in spite of its flaws, but almost to a degree because of some of its flaws, right?</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">Oh yeah, like there's some really fun stuff that occurs from flaws being unfixed. Like there was a bunch of, map glitches that were you could get outside the borders of the area and start running around. People were finding all these secrets, and this has been happening all the way back in D1, Destiny 1. People would glitch out of the map on the Cosmetrome, which is on Earth in Russia, and they would go into like the secret area that had, I think, the only time we fight a s- It's a certain enemy: a group called the House of Kings.</li>
                    <li class="interviewer">It's a designer's nightmare. But it's also to their delight and their nightmare all at the site, all at the same time, I'm sure.</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">It spawned a bunch of like returning gags. So for the 30th anniversary expansion, that they released back in COVID times they brought back this old bug and turned it into a dungeon. It was like a loot cave. It was an exploit where players were using it to get a lot of extremely powerful loot. And they turned it into this whole grandiose story of a t- team of players that went in there, seeking the loot and went crazy and started killing each other for it.</li>
                    <li class="interviewer">That's fantastic! I love it when developers can just sort of. Laugh at themselves and not take their their projects too seriously to an extent.</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">Absolutely. I feel like Bungie does a wonderful job of that. Their, their community managers and all their staff are just very kind individuals and very outwardly open about what's going on at Bungie. There have been some instances where they need to give more clarification, but they always get around to it.</li>
                    <li class="interviewer">Well, switching gears a bit, what were some of your favorite games growing up and why?</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">Oh my god let's see. Spyro. Spyro. The dragon was one of my all time favorites. Still probably to this day. I play the reignited trilogy almost every year. I think it's my favorite just because I liked, I like Spyro.</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">Spyro, the character himself was a very appealing character to me. I like the little purple dragon. I like that he was voiced by Tom Kenny, although I didn't know it was him at the time. I just liked his voice. And the little dragonfly that follows him, Spark, is also really cool. I love one of the first. Once I played there were levels where you just got to play as Spark and I love to go in through those sections as well because it gave a lot of variety and kind of deepened what was going on in the world. "I'm not just playing as Spyro. I'm playing on all these different characters" and you get to play as more than just spark. You get to play as like a kangaroo, a space monkey, a military penguin with a jet pack and rocket. It's crazy. That's why I like Spyro too. They're not really grounded in reality. They're just having fun with it. And I think that's one of the most important things you can have in any game.</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">Another one that I think really got me into some stuff. Later in my life was Legend of Zelda. I always liked like the sort of more linear Zelda where you like you're going from dungeon to dungeon. I'm not so much a fan of the open world ones. Although they are very impressive. I really liked the formula of going from dungeon to dungeon. And going through all that getting getting the items to beat the boss and saving the day. At the end of the day. It was a cool, it was a cool fantasy to live out in link in his many forms is just really fun to be around. I think my favorite one would have to be Twilight Princess or Windwaker. Both had very different art styles. I love the mechanics that they implemented in both of them. They each bring a more like a very different take on the Zelda universe. So I feel like it was very refreshing to play both of those. Especially since I started on Windwaker and went to Twilight Princess.</li>
                    <li class="interviewer">Right? I've always found that to be one of the most beautiful and like alluring parts about the Zelda series is its constant evolution, or at least its availableness to evolve. I feel like a lot of game IPs, they kind of get stuck, bogged down in the things that made their games famous,and made the money, and they're too afraid to try new things. For the longest time, like you said, like Legend of Zelda was a purely linear experience. There was a certain progression you had follow, sure, but it wasn't completely linear. You could stumble around and go to places you weren't supposed to yet but there's always sort of gates blocking you, item gates, quest gates. They went ahead and did away with all of that with Breath of the Wild and that's a that's a big jump, especially when your entire fan base is used to one type of gameplay experience.</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">I definitely feel like it alienated a lot of people going from linear to open world. But I also really sort of liked how they executed it. It's just not really what I play Zelda for. Crafting systems are great in other games. I don't really think it belongs in Zelda. I don't like the way that the dungeons were executed in that one either. They felt a lot A lot less complex. And they all just revolve around the Sheikah Slate. And I think different hero powers once you got to a certain part in the dungeon, but there was not a lot of gear that you would pick up besides the Sheikah Slate and I feel like that's something that Zelda is known for is having those cool gadgets. Like the Sheikah Slate is cool, but I would rather use the cool gear itself like I want to be firing hook shot, I want to be throwing the bombs. I want to be like, controlling the statues with the magic wand.</li>
                    <li class="interviewer">I definitely get what you mean, they kind of not simplified things, but sort of put them all in a conglomerate in this Sheikah Slate and in essence, almost sort of missed the point of the value of those types of gadgets was from the experience of having to collect that ability. And your gripe, at least from my outside opinion looking in is it's like, you kind of start with most if not all the Sheikah Slate abilities from the get go. You know what I mean? You have pretty much all of them to an extent. And it's like you there was you know, a small journey to unlock all of them but only in the tutorial. And then after that it's almost like they're they're opening a sandbox to you, but you already have all the tools. And part of what made Zelda fun was collecting the tools.</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">Yeah, there was a story the collecting the tools, in most cases, like you could tell from the area that you were in that you the people that were there use this tool to accomplish a certain thing. And now that's been left behind, it's there for you to find and you get to pick it up and you get to use it however they would have used it.</li>
                    <li class="interviewer">Kind of pivoting once again, but not even really pivoting so much as it is continuing this topic. Have you ever been dissatisfied with a game at release and why?</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">There's a couple that I've been actually kind of disappointed by, just the first one we can talk about is Turtle Rock studio's spiritual successor to Left 4 Dead, made originally by Valve and Turtle Rock back in the early 2000s. It's called Back 4 Blood. I was highly anticipating this game it looked really cool. They added a lot more guns and customizations but the writing in the story I feel like was not good. And the special infected in the game.</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">They're enemies that have special powers. There's your rank and file zombies, and then you have special ones. This was in Left 4 Dead and they brought it back in some capacity with Back 4 Blood, but I just feel like it's not the same.They don't have the same like personality they feel weaker, they feel more, I don't want to say, reliant on each other. But in comparison to Left 4 Dead you can make a good play with two infected and take out a whole team of survivors, whereas it feels like in this game if you have a team of four special infected, and a team of four survivors, one of the survivors could kill you all. It doesn't really feel like the special infected has that much impact.</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">The story was, again, just not where I wanted it to be with the writing. A lot of the voice lines did not click with me, they felt a little bit cheesy and out of place all the time. It had its moments, it had its moments, there was one level, towards the beginning of the game, where you have to create a distraction at a local bar and you hit the juice box that starts playing music and it goes through all these old, like really cool, fight songs. Black Betty I think, Rage Against the Machine was in there, and some other stuff, and it was it was a really cool like standoff. It was good storytelling, that was good set design, told from the environment. And the way that you got up there was really cool too. You're going like through all these different teams that like died, essentially trying to get to that one. But other than that level and a couple of other points in the game, The story was kind of lacking.</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">Another one, that I'm really surprised, I'm going to say this, but I used to really be sweet on this game. Because I'd play it like every day. I'm a big fan of sharks. This game called Depth. It's a very small indie team.</li>
                    <li class="interviewer">I think I've heard of it before it's the asymmetrical PvP, like scuba divers versus sharks, right?</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">Yeah, two sharks versus four divers. You're escorting a payload bot that's collecting treasure, and trying to just collect all the treasure that you can and make it back to the dive boat alive. The sharks see you as invaders in their territory, and they're trying to get you I absolutely love the gameplay loop to death with this game. I just feel like it didn't get enough attention. So they either didn't have enough backing to consider the game worth their time or they just don't have the manpower to do it. I don't understand the situation with them, but it just didn't feel like they were supporting the game enough. And it got really stale after a while. I absolutely love playing the game, but like I could only, if I played it today, probably play like one or two matches before I get bored of it.</li>
                    <li class="interviewer">Kind of reminds me, I feel like there is was an epidemic of like, the start of the whole early access trend in like the early 2010s. Like around like 2012 to 2015, there was a whole bunch of indie multiplayer games that just blew up on on YouTube and the whole internet space. Depth. Contagion. A lot of games that sort of spawned from like the old Gmod game modes, they sort of existed as like shells of game modes and they just weren't able to flesh themselves out into entire games in their own right.</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">That's the thing too, I feel like when you focus an entire game around a single game mode, you're gonna have issues. Like, unless you can constantly support it, and keep fleshing it out, you're gonna lose player base, you're gonna lose support for the game. And ultimately, it's not going to be worth it, you really need to have a set of core game modes, maybe even a campaign, that will keep your players busy, active and coming back.</li>
                    <li class="interviewer">One of the things that I think of, is when you have a game with multiple game modes, you obviously need like a like a flagship, like search and destroy or bomb defuse, like, you know, Counter Strike. But they have all these other random things like gun game, free for all, deathmatch. But then despite that, even if people only really want to play that one game mode, they only really want to play diffuse, right? Like the way that they keep that alive is a ranked system. There needs to be incentive to continue to play the same game mode, same game, every single time.</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">I feel like a game that executes that pretty well, is Overwatch. Granted, it has its issues, a lot of them, but the player base is healthy. It's growing. They keep adding new events and stuff that keeps the game feeling fresh enough. I feel like where they really need to step it up is getting that secondary experience out, because it was promised to us at the release of Overwatch 2. I think that was one of the biggest slaps in the face for me, because I was really a fan of Overwatch back in like 2017, prior to like all the shitty stuff that was happening at Blizzard, and then they they cleaned house, they came back, they're doing Overwatch 2. And I was like, "Alright, I might I might come back and hang if Overwatch 2 is good," but I need I need that PVE. It doesn't feel like a new game.</li>
                    <li class="interviewer">Yeah, they definitely made some promises, but I guess it's a matter of how they fulfill and whether they come. Because I feel like TV shows can have a redemption, right? They could have a bad season, they come back with a better one and win people over to some degree, but I feel like games, it's a lot more to show for it. A game can start out really horrendous and then become a absolute public darling. I think No Man's Sky is a is a perfect example. I remember the release of that game, and the utter hype surrounding it. And the utter just, you know, shock and awe when it finally released.</li>
