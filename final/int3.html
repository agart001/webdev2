                    <h1>Take Away</h1>
                    <p>Justin Santiago is, at his core, truly a gamer’s gamer. A man who truly loves the medium with all his heart and someone I trust to give an honest opinion when it is necessary, our interview proved that without a shadow of a doubt. As a person who has played video games at every stage of his life, Santiago understands what makes or breaks a game, what makes it a worthwhile investment of time, and what makes a player want to keep returning to play more. Santiago taught me that: Gamers value directed player agency. Gamers are willing to accept tasteful microtransactions or secondary purchases.</p>
                    <p>Santiago is a gamer who values his freedom. Games are a form of escapism and entertainment, Santiago would rather a game allows him the freedom to choose how he would like to employ that escapism and entertainment. While freedom is a powerful tool when designing a game, it can, however, deteriorate the experience, especially when the freedom is not directed in an effective manner. Directed freedom? Seems like an oxymoron, and it is, but in practice, directed freedom is a method of allowing player agency while also subtly puppeteering them towards fulfilling aspects of the game. Skyrim and Elden Ring, Santiago and I discussed, are games which expertly direct player agency, each game allows the player to go where they want, be who they want, and do what they want, while also subtly pointing them towards an end goal through their level design and story. Conversely, a game that, due to a lack of directed freedom, dissatisfied Santiago was Hollow, he stated, <i>“It just felt like lacking. And I didn't like the lack of direction. It, like, doesn't give you much. --- they can just throw you in. And it took me like, For, I mean, two hours just to get through like this first part and I was like nope. And I haven't touched the game since.”</i></p>
                    <p>Santiago is a reasonable man, a reasonable gamer if you will, and is willing to spend money on things that he deems have reasonable value, things that are not overzealous, predatory, or downright nonsensical. Santiago, like many gamers, is willing to spend money on a game after his initial purchase, but if he is going to fork over his hard-earned money it must be tasteful and worthwhile. The development of games is only getting more costly and more costly; Most gamers, like Santiago, understand that developers need to supplement their games with microtransactions or DLC to account for their overhead. An issue arises, however, when development studios, usually at the behest of their publishers, fill their games with lackluster microtransactions or cut their game into pieces to be slowly auctioned out as seasonal content. Santiago’s opinion is made very clear in his statement, <i>“I feel like some companies do it just right and some don't. Like, it's almost like, hey, we're gonna drop this game. This, you know, it feels partially complete. We're just gonna drop some more stuff along. The way and then add some DLCs that are essential if you want to progress, but you know, that's it. And that I don't like that much. But like some games do get it right. But I feel like that's typically just like multiplayer free to play games ---.”</i></p>

                <ul>
                    <li class="interviewer">Alrighty, so just a few starter questions here before we get into the real meat and potatoes. What is your full name?</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">Justin Francis Rodriguez Santiago.</li>
                    <li class="interviewer">And your age?</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">22.</li>
                    <li class="interviewer">And your current level of education? </li>
                    <li class="interviewee">Some college.</li>
                    <li class="interviewer">And your current employment?</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">IKEA.</li>
                    <li class="interviewer">Now we've got that out of the way. What are some of your favorite games currently? and why?</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">Okay, in terms of single-player, I really like RPGs, like Cyberpunk and a Dishonored series. Those I just love. Yeah, it's got a lot of RPG elements gives you a lot of flexibility. Different paths you can take so it has high replay value other than that. I like League of Legends and Destiny for like the, you know, the grinding or competitive aspects, you know.</li>
                    <li class="interviewer">And what were some of your favorite games growing up? and why?</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">Ooh, Skyrim. Cause like I said, I love RPG elements and, you know, the possibilities were not endless but plentiful. And then Minecraft cause, you know. You could just do survival or creative and just have a good time.</li>
                    <li class="interviewer">Gotcha. So it seems like freedom of player agency or player choice is kind of a big deal to you when it comes to the games that you enjoy.</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">Very big. It just feels more like immersive. Like I can get sucked into that world and have a good old time. Feel like I'm a part of it, you know? </li>
                    <li class="interviewer">Right. It's a lot easier to imprint on a character that you can change literally almost everything about.</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">Yeah, literally me.</li>
                    <li class="interviewer">Next question for you. Have you ever been dissatisfied with a game at release? and why?</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">Oh, man. Okay. This is gonna cause controversy. Hollow Knight is overrated. I personally like platforms are okay. And, Oh, man. I just couldn't get into it. It just felt like lacking. And I didn't like the lack of direction. It, Like, doesn't give you much.</li>
                    <li class="interviewer">What do you mean by like the lack of the direction?</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">Like it kind of throws you in the world. Yeah, it's kind of like, I mean like Dark Souls, except like that. I just, I don't know. I just learned because I didn't have many games to play, you know, growing up. I just had, Like that and I just was forced to deal with it. But now that like, I'll donate, eh, they can just throw you in. And it took me like, For, I mean, two hours just to get through like this first part and I was like nope. And I haven't touched the game since. I mean, like gameplay wise, it was fine though.</li>
                    <li class="interviewer">You didn't like hate the way that the game itself functioned outside of like it's levels?</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">I'm not big on like 2D platformers and stuff. So it just felt kind of boring to me.</li>
                    <li class="interviewer">Gotcha. It almost seems like kind of antithetical to your the things?</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">Yeah, and I like that certain sense. I don't know. Maybe that's just me being nitpicky, but I just didn't want to get too deep into it. I had no incentive to because it wasn't my style of game.</li>
                    <li class="interviewer">Right. It's like even with Skyrim while it's super open ended, there's still always that looming final boss battle with Alduin, you know what I mean?</li>
                    <li class="interviewer">Another one for you. Are you satisfied with the current video game market slash development culture? If not, why?</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">Oh, man, I'd say. I'm conflicted. I feel like some companies do it just right and some don't. Like, it's almost like, hey, we're gonna drop this game. This, you know, it feels partially complete. We're just gonna drop some more stuff along. The way and then add some DLCs that are essential if you want to progress, but you know, that's it. And that I don't like that much. But like some games do get it right. But I. I feel like that's typically just like multiplayer free to play games because I don't know man.</li>
                    <li class="interviewer">Alrighty, so next question. What's an example of a development studio, or company, even just a specific game you think does well as like a shining example of like "Good video game developer, Good video game?"</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">Yeah, I don't what you mean. Oh man.. Shoot. Oh, I would say Doom Eternal, Doom Eternal. S tier. Just like it was packed with so much stuff so much fun. You know, like. I'm replaying it again like a couple years later and I've already had a couple and I just feel like I could just keep on doing it and that's just a base game like I haven't even touched the DLC is like it's not like they're needed for progression or you want to get this super cool. I know I said I played Destiny but I kind of hate that there's like expansions come in all the time in order for you to like continue playing the game.</li>
                    <li class="interviewer">Right, it definitely feels like there's almost like a paywall. Every six or seven months.</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">Yeah, just range of bank accounts like buying a new game over and over again. But you know, it's the same thing. And then sometimes you don't even like it. Like I just got nightfall for Destiny and I hated it. It's so bad. But the old expansions are good.</li>
                    <li class="interviewer">So next one, do you feel as though developers creativity is stifled by corporate interest?</li>
                    <li class="interviewee"> Yes. A lot of things are worried about like profit. We're gonna do this, you know, make the money, but then like, I mean, I just feel like in any field, it just tends to, you know, suppress creativity to see don't have as much wiggle room because they care about profits more than anything else.</li>
                    <li class="interviewer">Right. I mean, what do you think would be like an example, in your personal experience, where you're like, "Alright, I see I see that someone was standing behind your shoulder in a suit telling you you couldn't do this?"</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">Anything from freaking Blizzard. World of Warcraft that went really to the poolper. I used to love that game, but recent, you know, obviously corporate decisions behind like the new expansion and stuff is just bad.</li>
                    <li class="interviewer">Right, I mean. That game, mmo's in general. It's they all follow the same sort of life cycle. Come out paid, then transfer to free to play, and then go to subscription based.</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">And then more expansions on top of that. Yeah. And then level boosts if you want them. Oh, and then character transfers and server transfers. It used to work with me, man, but not anymore.</li>
                    <li class="interviewer">Do you feel as though gamers' expectations for new games are too high?</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">No, I don't know, man. I feel like it's split even like some people are hyping up new games, getting all the pre-orders, and some people are like, no, never buy pre-orders. So I waste the time, especially in this market. It's like I said. You know, they'll drop partial game releases and then release more content and patches along the way. So then that tends to skew, like, the more the skeptics I want to say of the gamers community, but then there's other people that are just like, "oh, man. I love this company. Everything they put out was amazing," and they get it immediately. And sometimes that does like work, like, Elden Ring popped off, you know, that was one of like the perfect game releases. And then like Cyberpunk even though it's my favorite. But it definitely had a terrible release. So I think it's just hard to say like a definitive yes or no for the entire community. I think it's more of, you know, 50/50.</li>
                    <li class="interviewer">Right and another one for you, this is more so just one of food for thought really, Why do all modern games, indie and AAA, seem to share the same pillars of gameplay. Can new pillars be achieved? And a pillar of gameplay is basically just like, questing or combat or crafting, you know what I mean? Like. An example of like, a pillar would be Pokemon's battling system and its catching system.</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">Yeah, I just think that's more of like a, for lack of a better word, like generational thing in like gaming, like different generations of games are going to have different pillars. And then I think at the, I think that's a reason. Maybe we've just stagnated with that. And you know, coming the next few years, there might be some new ones, but I just think it's just a matter of time before someone comes up with something like really creative. And then that just takes over as another pillar within like the next decade. Or so with its creation, you know, right?</li>
                    <li class="interviewer">Alrighty. And then another question for you. What is a game modern or otherwise you feel has pushed the gaming industry, gaming as a genre forward? and why?</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">Oh, that's a good question, man. I'm gonna go on a limb, and say Elden Ring because that was just an amazing game release and it just took like they just took all the elements of like their older games slammed in some new ones, made it open world and then that just. Oh, you know, it's just so good.</li>
                    <li class="interviewer">And then final question for you. Do you have any Wishes are suggestions for the future of game development games as a genre, gamers game developers, like is there anything right now if you could change it, you would change it about any of those aspects of gaming?</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">Definitely less toxicity. I feel like people are way too mean to each other, especially in online games that just causes a lot of people to quit. Sometimes it really gets people's mentals down. Like, it's just, you know, stop. Just be nice. It's just a game. You know in terms of development. I don't know, man. Maybe more genre crossovers like, just do something really quirky and niche. I just want to see that work. I think that'd be funny. Yeah, kind of like, kind of like how Portal they just took like puzzles, first person, and voila, they just, you know, revolution area at the time. We just need some more something, something like that, man.</li>
                    <li class="interviewer">I can agree with you on the whole "gamers being too toxic." Like, sometimes people just, I don't know. I guess they- I have something going on in their own lives. It's like, man, why, why you gotta take it out on everybody else here in this game? We're all, we're all doing the exact same thing. Can't we find some camaraderie in that?</li>
                    <li class="interviewer">But thank you much, good sir. Thank you for letting me interview you, I appreciate it.</li>
                    <li class="interviewee">Of course, sir, anytime.</li>
